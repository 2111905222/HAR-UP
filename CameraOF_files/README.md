# Camera OF files


In this section you'll find the necessary files to work with our optical flow files from both cameras. Images were taken with a 640x480 pixel
format. From these images, the optical flow was stored in csv files, stating changes in *u* and *v* axis. To work with these files, we
joined them as lines, stating their timestamps. However, these file proved to be heavy, so a resize was made to work with them, changing 
the image size to 20x20 pixels.
