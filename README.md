## Multimodal System for Fall Detection

In this repository you'll be able to find the python programs used for the Universidad Panamericana's Multimodal System for Fall Detection.
 These are all written  in python.
 
We have the programs for feature selection, training and validation. Features were calculated using three different time-windows: 1&0.5, 2&1 and 3&1.5. For each timw-window, the first number refers to the separation (in seconds) in which the features were obtained, while the second number refers to the window-lenght (also in seconds) each feature considered.

The available programs are the following:


These were used in thw following manner and order:
